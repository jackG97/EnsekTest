# EnsekTest

There are 2 folders uploaded.

The Automation folder contains question 3
The Test Folder contains question 1 & 2

I used visual studio for the automation part. The technologies used were c# with Selenium Webdriver.
Within Visual studio, once the project is imported, you can run the test cases via Test explorer.
Its done using Chrome driver.

Important note - Question 3 was not completed due to timing issues. Only 2 out of 5 tests were covered.
